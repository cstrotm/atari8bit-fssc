#+Title: Full Scale Sector Copy (FSSC) 1.5.0

FSSC is a new copy program for Atari 8bit computers. It was specially
developed to copy floppy disks or hard disks with any number of
sectors (up to 65535 sectors). Thereby source and destination must be
either classic ATARI floppy disk drives (single or medium density) or
double- or quad-density drives according to the PERCOM standard. The
program reads the PERCOM table from the drives and copies the data
using this PERCOM data. Drives with double- or quad-density which do
not support the PERCOM standard will probably not work with this
program.

Source and target drive must support the same sector size, but may
have a different number of sectors. So it is possible to transfer a
single-density floppy disk (720 sectors) to a medium-density floppy
disk with 1040 sectors (or copy a medium-density floppy disk that is
not completely full to a single-density floppy disk).

The program tries to load and install a SIO highspeed routine from the
drives (according to the Speedy standard). If this is successful then
the respective drive is addressed with High-Speed, otherwise it will
be used only with normal SIO speed.

FSSC does not format the target disk, the target must always be
formatted.

FSSC can be started from a DOS or from a boot loader program (Pico-DOS
etc).

* Operation

Source and destination disks are selected using the keys 1-9 (source) and
Shift-1-9 (destination). The tool will try to read the floppy status
and PERCOM data of the drives.

Start the copy process with key "C" (Copy) or START.

After a successful (or failed) copy operation, the menu can be
displayed again by pressing the "M" key.

The "S" key shows details of the configuration of the source drive, the
F" key shows the details of the destination drive.

The key "D" lists the table of contents for DOS 2.5 compatible
disks.

The key "Q" exits the program, if it was started from a DOS
it will return to the DOS prompt or menu.

* Feedback

FSSC is open source software (GPL2 license), the program and the
source code can be found on Github at
https://github.com/cstrotm/atari8bit-fssc. Alternatively the current
version of FSSC can be found on the ABBUC FujiNet server at
fujinet://fujinet.abbuc.de/members/cas/diskutils/fssc.atr

Error messages and functional requests can be submitted on Github
(please create a ticket under "Issue").

FSSC is a fork of the ATR-Copy-Center (ACC; an archiving program for the
SIO2USB) and was programmed in SPL-6502-Atari (.
